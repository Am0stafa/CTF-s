# CTF Challenges Repository

Welcome to my CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges repository! This repository contains solutions and write-ups for various CTF challenges across multiple domains.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each representing a specific domain of CTF challenges. Here's an overview of the structure:

```
.
├── crypto/
├── web/
├── forensics/
├── reverse/
├── pwn/
└── README.md
```

- `crypto/`: Cryptography challenges
- `web/`: Web security challenges
- `forensics/`: Digital forensics challenges
- `reverse/`: Reverse engineering challenges
- `pwn/`: Binary exploitation challenges

## Domains

### Cryptography
This section contains solutions to cryptography-related challenges, including classic ciphers, modern encryption techniques, and cryptanalysis.

### Web Security
Here you'll find solutions to web-based challenges, covering topics such as XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, and other web vulnerabilities.

### Digital Forensics
This section includes solutions to forensics challenges, involving file analysis, network packet inspection, and digital artifact examination.

### Reverse Engineering
Solutions to reverse engineering challenges, including binary analysis, disassembly, and code comprehension tasks.

### Binary Exploitation (Pwn)
This section covers solutions to binary exploitation challenges, focusing on buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other low-level security issues.
