## The Explanation:

What is the Legendre Symbol?
The Legendre Symbol is a mathematical shortcut to determine if a number is a quadratic residue (has a square root) in modular arithmetic. Instead of trying every possible number to find a square root, it gives us a quick yes/no answer.

How does it work?
The Legendre Symbol (a/p) can give three values:
+1: means "a" has a square root modulo p
-1: means "a" does NOT have a square root modulo p
0: means "a" is divisible by p
```
Quadratic Residue * Quadratic Residue = Quadratic Residue       (+1 * +1 = +1)
Quadratic Residue * Quadratic Non-residue = Quadratic Non-residue (+1 * -1 = -1)
Quadratic Non-residue * Quadratic Non-residue = Quadratic Residue (-1 * -1 = +1)
```
