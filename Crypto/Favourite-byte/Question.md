### The Question:

For the next few challenges, you'll use what you've just learned to solve some more XOR puzzles.

I've hidden some data using XOR with a single byte, but that byte is a secret. Don't forget to decode from hex first.

### Explanation:

This challenge involves decrypting a message that has been encrypted using the XOR operation with a single byte key. Here's a breakdown of the problem and the approach to solve it:

1. The given string is in hexadecimal format, representing the encrypted message.
2. The encryption was done by XORing each byte of the original message with a single, unknown byte (the "favourite byte").
3. To decrypt the message, we need to find this single byte key.
4. Once we find the correct key, XORing the encrypted message with this key will reveal the original message.
5. We know that the decrypted message should start with "crypto{", which gives us a way to verify when we've found the correct key.

The approach to solve this problem involves:
1. Converting the hexadecimal string to bytes.
2. Trying all possible single byte values (0-255) as the key.
3. XORing the encrypted bytes with each potential key.
4. Checking if the result starts with "crypto{".
5. If found, we've successfully decrypted the message and obtained the flag.

### Solution:

Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. First, we'll define a function to XOR bytes with a single byte key:

2. Next, we'll implement a function to find the flag:

3. Finally, we'll call this function with the given hexadecimal string and print the result.
