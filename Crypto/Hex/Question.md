### The Question:

When we encrypt something the resulting ciphertext commonly has bytes which are not printable ASCII characters. If we want to share our encrypted data, it's common to encode it into something more user-friendly and portable across different systems.

Hexadecimal can be used in such a way to represent ASCII strings. First each letter is converted to an ordinal number according to the ASCII table (as in the previous challenge). Then the decimal numbers are converted to base-16 numbers, otherwise known as hexadecimal. The numbers can be combined together, into one long hex string.

Included below is a flag encoded as a hex string. Decode this back into bytes to get the flag.

### Explanation:

Hexadecimal encoding is a common method used to represent binary data in a human-readable format. It's particularly useful when dealing with encrypted or binary data that may contain non-printable ASCII characters. Here's how the process works:

1. ASCII to Decimal: Each character in the original string is converted to its decimal ASCII value.
2. Decimal to Hexadecimal: These decimal values are then converted to their hexadecimal (base-16) equivalents.
3. Concatenation: All the hexadecimal values are combined into a single string.

To decode a hex string back to ASCII:

1. Split the hex string into pairs of characters (each pair represents one byte).
2. Convert each pair from hexadecimal to decimal.
3. Convert each decimal value to its corresponding ASCII character.

Python provides built-in methods to handle this conversion efficiently, which we'll use in our solution.

### Solution:

To solve this problem, we'll use Python's built-in `bytes.fromhex()` method to convert the hexadecimal string to bytes, and then decode those bytes to ASCII. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Define a function to decode the hex string:
   ```python
   def decode_hex(hex_string):
       return bytes.fromhex(hex_string).decode('ascii')
   ```

2. Use the function to decode the given hex string:
   ```python
   hex_encoded_flag = "63727970746f7b596f755f77696c6c5f62655f776f726b696e675f776974685f6865785f737472696e67735f615f6c6f747d"
   decoded_flag = decode_hex(hex_encoded_flag)
   ```

3. Print the decoded flag:
   ```python
   print(f"The decoded flag is: {decoded_flag}")
   ```

This solution efficiently decodes the hex string to reveal the hidden flag. The `bytes.fromhex()` method handles the conversion from hex to bytes, and `decode('ascii')` converts the bytes to an ASCII string.
