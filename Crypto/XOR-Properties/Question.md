### The Question:

In the last challenge, you saw how XOR worked at the level of bits. In this one, we're going to cover the properties of the XOR operation and then use them to undo a chain of operations that have encrypted a flag. Gaining an intuition for how this works will help greatly when you come to attacking real cryptosystems later, especially in the block ciphers category.

There are four main properties we should consider when we solve challenges using the XOR operator

Commutative: A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A
Associative: A ⊕ (B ⊕ C) = (A ⊕ B) ⊕ C
Identity: A ⊕ 0 = A
Self-Inverse: A ⊕ A = 0

Let's break this down. Commutative means that the order of the XOR operations is not important. Associative means that a chain of operations can be carried out without order (we do not need to worry about brackets). The identity is 0, so XOR with 0 "does nothing", and lastly something XOR'd with itself returns zero.

Let's put this into practice! Below is a series of outputs where three random keys have been XOR'd together and with the flag. Use the above properties to undo the encryption in the final line to obtain the flag.

KEY1 = a6c8b6733c9b22de7bc0253266a3867df55acde8635e19c73313
KEY2 ^ KEY1 = 37dcb292030faa90d07eec17e3b1c6d8daf94c35d4c9191a5e1e
KEY2 ^ KEY3 = c1545756687e7573db23aa1c3452a098b71a7fbf0fddddde5fc1
FLAG ^ KEY1 ^ KEY3 ^ KEY2 = 04ee9855208a2cd59091d04767ae47963170d1660df7f56f5faf

 Before you XOR these objects, be sure to decode from hex to bytes.

### Explanation:

This challenge focuses on understanding and applying the properties of the XOR (exclusive or) operation in cryptography. The key properties highlighted are:

1. Commutative: A ⊕ B = B ⊕ A
2. Associative: A ⊕ (B ⊕ C) = (A ⊕ B) ⊕ C
3. Identity: A ⊕ 0 = A
4. Self-Inverse: A ⊕ A = 0

The challenge provides a series of XOR operations involving three keys (KEY1, KEY2, KEY3) and a flag. The goal is to use these properties to reverse the encryption and recover the original flag.

The main concept to understand is that XORing the same value twice cancels out the operation. This is due to the self-inverse property: (A ⊕ B) ⊕ B = A.

By cleverly applying the XOR operation and its properties, we can isolate and eliminate the keys to reveal the flag.

### Solution:

The solution uses Python to implement the XOR operations and recover the flag. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. First, we define a helper function `xor_bytes` to perform XOR operations on byte objects.

2. We decode all the provided hex strings into bytes for easier manipulation.

3. To recover KEY2, we XOR KEY1 with (KEY2 ⊕ KEY1). This cancels out KEY1, leaving us with KEY2.

4. To recover KEY3, we XOR the newly found KEY2 with (KEY2 ⊕ KEY3). This cancels out KEY2, leaving us with KEY3.

5. Now that we have all three keys, we can reverse the final operation. We XOR the encrypted flag with KEY1, KEY3, and KEY2 in sequence. This cancels out all the keys, leaving us with the original flag.

6. Finally, we convert the resulting bytes to a UTF-8 string to read the flag.
